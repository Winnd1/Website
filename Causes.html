        <p>Personality is the combination of thoughts, emotions and behaviors that makes you unique. It's the way you view, understand and relate to the outside world, as well as how you see yourself. Personality forms during childhood, shaped through an interaction of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your genes. Certain personality traits may be passed on to you by your parents through inherited genes. These traits are sometimes called your temperament.</li>
            <li>Your environment. This involves the surroundings you grew up in, events that occurred, and relationships with family members and others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Personality disorders are thought to be caused by a combination of these genetic and environmental influences. Your genes may make you vulnerable to developing a personality disorder, and a life situation may trigger the actual development.</p>

        <h2>Other risk factors</h2>
        <p>Although the precise cause of personality disorders is not known, certain factors seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering personality disorders, including:</p>

            <li>Abusive, unstable or chaotic family life during childhood</li>
            <li>Being diagnosed with childhood conduct disorder</li>
            <li>Variations in brain chemistry and structure</li>
